	<h1>PubMap</h1>
	<h2>The world of publications</h2>
	<p>PubMap is a search engine designed to find scientific
		publications by the geographic regions they refer to. It will allow
		you to access knowledge specific to your geographic area of interest.
		You can either search for publications by specific geographic
		coordinates and and radius around them or you choose from a list of
		regions. Then you will find publications about research going on in
		this exact area.</p>
	<p>Our PubMap database relies on the community, therefore to fill
		and update our database we need your help. Please install Megxbar and
		help us with geo-refrencing publications. MegxBar is a very simple to
		use firefox application for this task. While reading a paper just add
		longitute and latitude of the samples used in the study and submit it
		to our database.</p>
	<p>PubMap Stats shows an statistical overview about the current top
		five research areas according to the current PubMap database</p>
